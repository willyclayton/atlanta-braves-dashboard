Greg Maddux, who would go on to win the Cy Young Award that season, delivered a masterful performance, allowing only two runs over eight innings and striking out six batters. The Braves ultimately won the game 6-2, solidifying their lead in the National League East as they geared up for a successful postseason run that culminated in a trip to the World Series."
