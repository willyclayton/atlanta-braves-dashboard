  "content": "On July 2, 1992, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade that would help solidify their pitching rotation for years to come. They acquired standout pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs, a move that would ultimately lead to Maddux becoming one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history. This signing marked the beginning of a dominant era for the Braves, as Maddux would go on to win four consecutive Cy Young Awards and play a pivotal role in the team's success throughout the 1990s."
