  "content": "On October 17, 1992, the Atlanta Braves faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series. The Braves, who were seeking their first trip to the World Series since moving to Atlanta, triumphed with a thrilling 1-0 victory. Tom Glavine delivered a masterful pitching performance, allowing just one hit over eight scoreless innings, and Mark Wohlers closed it out, sending the Braves to the World Series for the first time in Atlanta. This game solidified the Braves' dominance in the early '90s and marked a significant moment in the franchise's history."
