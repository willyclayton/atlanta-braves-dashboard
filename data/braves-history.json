  "content": "On November 8, 1991, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by trading for pitcher Tom Glavine's future Hall of Fame teammate, Greg Maddux. The Braves signed Maddux to a five-year deal worth $28 million, a record at the time for a pitcher. This acquisition would prove pivotal, as Maddux went on to become one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history, helping lead the Braves to a World Series title in 1995 and earning multiple Cy Young Awards during his tenure with the team."
