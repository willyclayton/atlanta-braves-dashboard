The Braves, led by ace pitcher Tom Glavine, secured a 7-1 victory at Wrigley Field, which was pivotal in their run to the postseason. This win contributed to their remarkable turnaround from the previous year, ultimately leading to a thrilling run that culminated in their first National League pennant in Atlanta. Glavine's strong performance was a key factor, as he struck out seven batters and continued to establish himself as one of the premier pitchers in the league."
