  "content": "On November 15, 1996, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by trading for pitcher Kevin Millwood, who would go on to become a key part of their pitching staff. Millwood, a promising young talent, was acquired from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for outfielder David Justice. This trade not only bolstered the Braves' rotation, but it also paved the way for Millwood to eventually help lead the team to a World Series championship in 1999."
