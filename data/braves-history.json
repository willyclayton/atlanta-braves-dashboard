They acquired power-hitting outfielder David Justice from the New York Yankees in exchange for pitcher Steve Bedrosian. Justice would go on to become a key player in the Braves' success during the 1990s, helping lead the team to a World Series championship in 1995 and earning the 1990 Rookie of the Year award."
