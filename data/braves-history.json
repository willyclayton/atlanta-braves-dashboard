  "content": "On October 12, 1991, the Atlanta Braves faced the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The game became a classic, highlighted by a legendary pitching duel between Braves' ace Tom Glavine and the Pirates' Doug Drabek. Glavine delivered a masterful performance, allowing just one run and leading the Braves to a 4-0 victory, clinching their first pennant since moving to Atlanta and setting the stage for their World Series appearance that year."
