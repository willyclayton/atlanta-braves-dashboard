  "content": "On October 9, 1991, the Atlanta Braves faced off against the Pittsburgh Pirates in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series. The game, held at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, was a nail-biter that ended with the Braves winning 4-0, securing their first pennant since moving to Atlanta. Tom Glavine delivered a masterful performance, pitching eight scoreless innings and earning the victory, while the Bravesâ€™ offense was fueled by a two-run homer from David Justice, propelling the team to the World Series."
