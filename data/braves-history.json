  "content": "On October 31, 1992, the Atlanta Braves faced the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 3 of the World Series at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The Braves, led by stellar pitching from Tom Glavine, won the game 3-1, thanks in part to a crucial two-run double by David Justice. This victory marked the Braves' first World Series game win since relocating to Atlanta, as they sought to claim their first championship title since the franchise's move from Milwaukee."
