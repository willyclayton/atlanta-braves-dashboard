  "content": "On September 25, 1993, the Atlanta Braves clinched the National League East title by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies 6-3 at Veterans Stadium. This victory marked the Braves' second consecutive division title and was a key moment in their dominant run during the early 1990s. Greg Maddux, who went on to win the Cy Young Award that season, pitched a stellar game, solidifying his reputation as one of the era's best pitchers."
