  "content": "On January 11, 1982, the Atlanta Braves made franchise history by signing free agent pitcher Bob Walk, who would become a key contributor to their pitching rotation. This marked one of the early moves in what would eventually build toward the team's dominant 1990s run. The Braves' commitment to strengthening their pitching staff during the offseason would prove to be a formula they'd use successfully throughout the decade."
