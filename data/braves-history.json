  "content": "On November 6, 1991, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade, acquiring outfielder David Justice from the New York Yankees in exchange for pitcher Jim Clancy. This move would prove pivotal as Justice played a key role in the Braves' success during the early 1990s, contributing to their run of division titles and their eventual appearance in the World Series in 1991. His powerful bat and clutch performances, including a memorable home run in Game 1 of the 1995 World Series, solidified his place in Braves lore."
