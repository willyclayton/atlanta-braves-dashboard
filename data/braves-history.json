Tom Glavine delivered a stellar performance, throwing eight shutout innings and leading the Braves to a 1-0 victory at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. Fred McGriff's solo home run in the fifth inning provided the only run needed, cementing the Braves' place in baseball history and ending a 38-year championship drought for the franchise."
