  "content": "On September 21, 1991, the Atlanta Braves achieved a significant milestone by clinching the National League West title, marking their first division championship since moving to Atlanta. This victory was part of a remarkable turn-around season under manager Bobby Cox, as the Braves went from a 65-97 record in 1990 to a 94-68 record in 1991. The clinching game featured standout performances from pitchers like Tom Glavine, who helped solidify their place in the postseason and set the stage for their eventual World Series appearance that year."
