  "content": "On July 19, 1994, the Atlanta Braves hosted the San Diego Padres and witnessed a remarkable performance from pitcher Greg Maddux. Maddux threw a complete game shutout, allowing only three hits while striking out seven batters. This game was part of a dominant season for Maddux, who would go on to win the Cy Young Award that year, solidifying his reputation as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history."
