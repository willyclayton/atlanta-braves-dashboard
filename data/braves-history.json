  "content": "On October 5, 1991, the Atlanta Braves clinched the National League pennant by defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 in Game 7 of the NLCS. This victory marked the Braves' return to the World Series for the first time since their move to Atlanta, thanks in large part to a stellar performance by pitcher Tom Glavine, who threw eight shutout innings. The game solidified the Braves' reputation as a dominant force in the early '90s, setting the stage for their World Series appearance later that month."
