  "content": "On November 18, 1991, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by trading for outfielder David Justice. This acquisition would prove pivotal for the Braves as Justice would become a key player in their success during the early 1990s, helping the team reach the World Series in 1991 and 1992. Justice's power and clutch hitting would earn him a reputation as one of the franchise's beloved players during their dominant run in the National League."
