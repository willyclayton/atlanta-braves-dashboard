This victory not only secured their place in the World Series but also marked the Braves' first pennant since moving to Atlanta. Greg Maddux delivered a stellar performance on the mound, pitching a complete game shutout and allowing just four hits, showcasing the dominant pitching that characterized the Braves during the 1990s."
