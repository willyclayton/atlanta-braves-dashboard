  "content": "On December 1, 1992, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade that would bolster their pitching staff for years to come. They acquired future Hall of Famer Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs, signing him to a five-year contract worth $28 million. This move was pivotal, as Maddux would go on to win four consecutive Cy Young Awards while with the Braves, solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history and helping lead the team to a World Series title in 1995."
