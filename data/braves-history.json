  "content": "On July 31, 1994, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade, acquiring pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs. This trade would go on to have a monumental impact on the franchise, as Maddux became one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history and a key player in the Braves' success during the 1990s. He won four consecutive Cy Young Awards while with Atlanta and was instrumental in leading the team to a World Series championship in 1995."
