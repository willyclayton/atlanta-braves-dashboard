  "content": "On July 13, 1991, the Atlanta Braves played a crucial game against the New York Mets, which was a pivotal moment in their season. The Braves, led by pitcher Tom Glavine, secured a 5-4 victory, marking the beginning of a remarkable second half that propelled them to the National League pennant. This win was part of a stunning turnaround for the team, which had struggled in the first half of the season but ended up winning the division and reaching the World Series. Glavine's performance was instrumental, as he went on to win the Cy Young Award that season."
