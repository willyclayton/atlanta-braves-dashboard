  "content": "On June 21, 1991, the Atlanta Braves showcased their impressive pitching prowess as they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4-2 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. This game was highlighted by a stellar performance from pitcher Tom Glavine, who struck out 11 batters, marking one of the many dominant outings that would contribute to his eventual Cy Young Award later that season. The victory was part of the Braves' remarkable turnaround that year, ultimately leading them to the World Series."
