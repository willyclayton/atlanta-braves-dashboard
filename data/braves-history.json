Tom Glavine delivered a masterful performance, pitching eight shutout innings and allowing just one hit, while the Braves' offense scored 1-0, thanks to a lone run driven in by David Justice. This historic victory solidified the Braves' place in baseball history and marked the culmination of a dominant era in the 1990s for the franchise."
