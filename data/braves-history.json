  "content": "On August 15, 1974, Hank Aaron hit his 733rd career home run, surpassing Babe Ruth on the all-time home run list. This historic moment took place at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, where Aaron connected off of Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Al Downing. The milestone was a significant part of Aaron's legendary career and solidified his status as one of baseball's greatest players, especially as he approached the record of 755 home runs held by Ruth."
