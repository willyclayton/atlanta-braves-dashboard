The Braves rallied from a 5-1 deficit to win 7-6, with David Justice hitting a crucial two-run homer in the eighth inning. This victory was part of the Braves' impressive 14-game winning streak that summer, which helped them secure the National League pennant and ultimately reach the World Series later that year."
