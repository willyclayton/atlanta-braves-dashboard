  "content": "On July 28, 1996, the Atlanta Braves faced the New York Mets in a pivotal game that highlighted their dominant season. In this contest, Braves pitcher Greg Maddux threw a complete game, allowing only one run while striking out eight batters. This performance helped solidify Maddux's reputation as one of the premier pitchers of his era, contributing to the Braves' eventual World Series championship that year."
