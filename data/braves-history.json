  "content": "On October 15, 1995, the Atlanta Braves clinched the National League Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds, winning the series 4-0. This victory marked the Braves' return to the World Series for the first time since their relocation to Atlanta. Tom Glavine pitched a stellar game, allowing only one run over eight innings, securing his place as a key figure in the Braves' success during the 1990s. The triumph was a crucial step toward the Braves ultimately winning the World Series that year, their first in Atlanta."
