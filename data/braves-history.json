  "content": "On October 21, 1992, the Atlanta Braves clinched the National League pennant by defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates 1-0 in Game 7 of the NL Championship Series. The game was a nail-biter, with Tom Glavine delivering a brilliant performance on the mound, pitching eight shutout innings and allowing only one hit. The decisive run came from a scored single by David Justice, propelling the Braves to the World Series for the first time since their move to Atlanta. This moment marked a significant milestone in the franchise's history, as it set the stage for their eventual appearance in the 1992 World Series."
