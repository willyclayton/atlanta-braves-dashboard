The Braves defeated the San Diego Padres 5-3 at Fulton County Stadium, led by a strong performance from pitcher Tom Glavine, who went eight innings and struck out ten batters. This victory marked the beginning of a dominant era for the Braves, culminating in their run to the World Series that season."
