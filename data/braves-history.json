The Braves secured the title with a 7-1 victory over the San Diego Padres at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, highlighted by a strong performance from pitcher Phil Niekro, who threw a complete game. This moment was significant as it set the stage for the Braves' return to postseason play, ultimately leading them to the World Series that year."
