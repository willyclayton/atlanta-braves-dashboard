  "content": "On July 22, 1982, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by acquiring future Hall of Famer, first baseman, and outfielder, Bob Horner from the Atlanta Braves. Horner, who had previously been a star with the team since they relocated to Atlanta, would go on to play a pivotal role in helping the Braves secure their division title that year. This acquisition was part of a broader strategy that solidified the Braves' roster during a pivotal season, setting the stage for their eventual success in the late 1980s and 1990s."
