  "content": "On November 29, 1990, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade that would shape the franchise for years to come, acquiring future Hall of Famer Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres. McGriff, who would become a cornerstone of the Braves' lineup, helped lead the team to a World Series championship in 1995. His power-hitting and consistency were critical during the Braves' dominant run in the 1990s, making this trade one of the most pivotal moments in the franchise's history."
