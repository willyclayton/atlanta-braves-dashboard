This trade would prove pivotal, as McGriff went on to become one of the franchise's most iconic hitters, contributing to the Braves' success in the 1990s, including their World Series championship in 1995. McGriff's power and consistency solidified the Braves' lineup and helped establish them as a dominant force in Major League Baseball."
