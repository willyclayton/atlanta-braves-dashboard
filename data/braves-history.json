  "content": "On November 13, 1990, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by trading for starting pitcher Tom Glavine, who would go on to become one of the most iconic players in franchise history. Glavine, drafted by the Braves in 1984, would eventually solidify the team's rotation and help lead the Braves to five consecutive division titles in the 1990s, as well as winning two Cy Young Awards. This trade marked the beginning of a new era for the Braves, establishing a foundation for their success in the coming decade."
