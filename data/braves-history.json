  "content": "On November 19, 1992, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by acquiring pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs. Maddux, who would go on to become one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, signed a five-year contract worth $28 million. This acquisition was pivotal, as Maddux would help lead the Braves to 14 consecutive division titles and solidify their pitching rotation during the 1990s."
