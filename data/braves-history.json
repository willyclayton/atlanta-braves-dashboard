  "content": "On September 7, 1991, the Atlanta Braves faced the San Diego Padres in a thrilling game that showcased the team's remarkable turnaround that season. The Braves, led by manager Bobby Cox, were in the midst of a surprising run that would culminate in their first division title since moving to Atlanta. In this game, pitcher Tom Glavine threw a complete game, allowing just one run and helping the Braves secure a 7-1 victory, further solidifying their position in the National League East. This year marked the beginning of a dominant era for the franchise, leading to multiple postseason appearances in the years to come."
