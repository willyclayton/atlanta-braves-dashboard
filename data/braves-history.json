This moment marked the culmination of an incredible season, as the Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in six games to secure their first championship in Atlanta since relocating from Milwaukee in 1966. The parade honored the team's key players, including Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Chipper Jones, solidifying the Braves' legacy in the city and their status as a baseball powerhouse in the 1990s."
