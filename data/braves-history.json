This game featured an outstanding performance by pitcher Tom Glavine, who threw a complete game shutout, striking out 10 batters and solidifying his role as a key player in the Braves' rotation. This win was part of the Braves' remarkable turnaround season, ultimately leading to their first division title in 1991 and setting the stage for their dominance in the National League throughout the 1990s."
