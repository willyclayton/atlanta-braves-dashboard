  "content": "On September 23, 1982, the Atlanta Braves clinched the National League West title, marking their return to the playoffs for the first time since 1974. The Braves secured the division with a 4-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, thanks in part to a strong pitching performance from Phil Niekro, who notched his 20th win of the season. This moment was significant as it signified the beginning of a successful era for the franchise, leading to their first World Series appearance in Atlanta."
