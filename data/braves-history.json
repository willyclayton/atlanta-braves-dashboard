  "content": "On October 16, 1996, the Atlanta Braves clinched the National League pennant by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 4-0 in Game 6 of the NLCS. This victory at Busch Stadium allowed the Braves to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1995, thanks in large part to a stellar performance by pitcher Greg Maddux, who threw a complete game shutout. The win marked a significant moment in the Braves' memorable run during the 1990s, solidifying their status as one of the dominant teams in baseball during that era."
