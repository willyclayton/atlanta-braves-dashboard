  "content": "On November 24, 1992, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade that would help solidify their pitching rotation for years to come. The team acquired right-handed pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs, who would go on to become one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history. Maddux would win four consecutive Cy Young Awards with the Braves from 1993 to 1996, playing a pivotal role in the team's success during the 1990s, including their 1995 World Series championship."
