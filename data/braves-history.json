  "content": "On June 24, 1974, Hank Aaron hit his 700th career home run, becoming only the third player in MLB history to reach that milestone, joining Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. Aaron achieved this historic feat while playing for the Atlanta Braves in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Fulton County Stadium. His powerful swing sent the ball deep into the stands, further solidifying his legacy as one of baseball's greatest hitters. This moment not only marked a significant personal achievement for Aaron but also a landmark event in the history of the Braves franchise."
