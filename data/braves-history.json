  "content": "On August 17, 1996, the Atlanta Braves faced the Philadelphia Phillies in a game that showcased the prowess of pitcher Greg Maddux. Maddux tossed a complete game, allowing only one run and striking out six, leading the Braves to a 7-1 victory. This performance was a classic example of Maddux's dominance during the season, as he went on to secure his fourth consecutive Cy Young Award that year, further solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history."
