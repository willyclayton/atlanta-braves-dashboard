  "content": "On November 26, 1990, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade that would shape their future by acquiring pitcher Tom Glavine from the New York Mets in exchange for a minor league player. Glavine would go on to become one of the most iconic pitchers in Braves history, helping lead the team to multiple division titles and a World Series championship in 1995. This move marked the beginning of a dominant era for the Braves, as Glavine would eventually be inducted into the Hall of Fame."
