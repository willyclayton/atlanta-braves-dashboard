The Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in a dramatic six-game series, with Tom Glavine earning the decisive victory in Game 6. This victory marked a significant milestone for the franchise, as it was their first championship since the Boston Braves won in 1914, and it solidified the Braves' dominance in the 1990s, culminating in a season that showcased their pitching prowess and strong lineup."
