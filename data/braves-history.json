  "content": "On June 30, 1973, the Atlanta Braves faced the New York Mets at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, where Hank Aaron hit his 700th career home run. This monumental achievement made Aaron the third player in Major League Baseball history to reach the 700-home run milestone, joining Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. The moment solidified Aaron's legacy as one of the greatest sluggers in baseball history, and he remains a key figure in Braves lore."
