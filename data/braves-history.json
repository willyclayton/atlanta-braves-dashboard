  "content": "On September 20, 1991, the Atlanta Braves achieved a remarkable milestone by clinching the National League West title, marking their first division championship since 1982. This victory was part of their impressive turnaround under manager Bobby Cox, as the Braves went from a last-place finish the previous year to a postseason contender. The clinching game was a 6-4 win over the San Diego Padres, with standout performances from players like Tom Glavine, who pitched brilliantly down the stretch, solidifying Atlanta's return to glory."
