  "content": "On July 23, 1992, the Atlanta Braves achieved a remarkable milestone by winning their 14th consecutive game, defeating the San Francisco Giants 5-1 at Candlestick Park. This victory propelled the Braves to the top of the National League West standings and showcased the pitching prowess of Tom Glavine, who threw a complete game, allowing just one run. This winning streak would be a pivotal moment in the Braves' season, as they would go on to claim the division title and eventually reach the World Series."
