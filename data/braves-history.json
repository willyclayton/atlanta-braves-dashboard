  "content": "On October 20, 1995, the Atlanta Braves clinched their fourth consecutive National League pennant by defeating the Cincinnati Reds 5-0 in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series. Greg Maddux, the ace of the pitching staff, threw a brilliant complete game shutout, allowing only three hits and striking out six batters. This victory propelled the Braves to the World Series, where they would ultimately win their first championship since relocating to Atlanta."
