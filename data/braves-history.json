  "content": "On November 10, 1995, the Atlanta Braves made a significant move by trading for outfielder David Justice, a key player who had helped the team during their successful run in the early 1990s. Justice had been a mainstay in the Braves lineup, contributing to their World Series championship that same year. This trade solidified the Braves' commitment to building a winning team, as they had already established themselves as a powerhouse in the National League throughout the decade."
