  "content": "On November 22, 1991, the Atlanta Braves made a significant trade that set the stage for their future success by acquiring outfielder David Justice from the New York Yankees. This move proved pivotal, as Justice would go on to become a key player in the Braves' lineup during their rise to prominence in the 1990s, including playing a crucial role in their 1995 World Series championship. Justice's combination of power and clutch hitting helped solidify the Braves' reputation as a dominant force in Major League Baseball during that era."
