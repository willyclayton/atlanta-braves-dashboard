  "content": "On June 25, 1972, the Atlanta Braves experienced a remarkable moment when Hank Aaron hit his 600th career home run at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. This historic blast came off San Diego Padres pitcher Mike Corkins, making Aaron the third player in Major League Baseball history to reach the 600-home run milestone, joining Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. The achievement was celebrated by fans and solidified Aaron's legacy as one of the game's greatest sluggers."
