Spencer Strider pitched effectively, allowing just two earned runs over seven innings, but it wasn't enough to secure a win. \n\nKey highlights from the game include:\n1. Sean Murphy's solo home run provided the Braves' only run of the game.\n2. Matt Olson contributed with two hits, but the team struggled to capitalize on scoring opportunities.\n3. The Braves' defense held the Phillies to just two runs, but the lack of offensive production ultimately led to their defeat.",
