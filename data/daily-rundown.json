Despite a solid performance from Dylan Dodd, who pitched three scoreless innings, the bullpen struggled to contain the Rangers' offense. \n\nKey highlights include:\n1. Dylan Dodd's impressive strikeout total of four in just three innings.\n2. Michael Harris II's two hits, showcasing his ability to get on base.\n3. Sean Murphy driving in the only run for the Braves, but the team's overall offensive output was lacking.",
