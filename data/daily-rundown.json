Ozzie Albies had a standout performance, hitting a home run and driving in five runs.\n2. Michael Harris II also contributed with a home run and two RBIs.\n3. The Braves managed to score nine runs but could not outpace the Yankees' twelve runs, highlighting a lack of pitching depth in the later innings.",
