  "rundown": "<b>1-3</b> L vs Milwaukee Brewers  \n<b>Erick Fedde:</b> 5.1 innings, 3 earned runs, 3 hits, 1 HR, 0 strikeouts  \n<b>Batters:</b>  \nJurickson Profar (1 hits - 3 AB, 1 HR, 1 RBI)  \n\nThe Braves fell to the Milwaukee Brewers, managing only one run despite a solid performance from their hitters. The loss was primarily due to the three earned runs given up by Erick Fedde, which proved too much for the Braves' offense to overcome. \n\nKey highlights from the game include:  \n1. Jurickson Profar hit a home run, providing the Braves' only run of the game.  \n2. Fedde struggled with strikeouts, finishing the game with none, which limited his effectiveness.  \n3. Both teams had the same number of hits (3), but the Brewers capitalized on their opportunities better.",
