Despite out-hitting the Orioles, the Braves' pitching struggled to contain the offense. \n\nKey highlights include:\n1. Austin Riley and Matt Olson both contributed significantly with home runs and multiple RBIs.\n2. The Braves managed 10 hits but could not capitalize on their scoring opportunities.\n3. Dylan Dodd's early exit after 2.2 innings put pressure on the bullpen, which ultimately could not hold the lead.",
